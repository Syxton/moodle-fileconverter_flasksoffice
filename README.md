ABOUT
==========
This is a tool that enables Moodle to use a separat Linux server with
LibreOffice for converting documents. For example, this is useful in
assignment submissions. In combination with a Linux Ubuntu server with
LibreOffice, submitted text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations
are automatically converted to PDF to simplify the grading workflow.

The plugin uses a Flask rest interface to a LibreOffice on a Linux
server. The installation and configuration of the Flask rest interface
is described in the associated repository.

It is based on the Google Drive document converter plugin.
